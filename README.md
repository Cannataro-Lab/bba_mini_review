# Code associated with Cannataro et al. BBA mini-review 

This code will reproduce the analysis within the review, including downloading the data, running the calculations, and creating the figures.


Run through `R/MAIN_script.R` to complete analysis. If first time running, you may have to remove comments on the `source()` files at the beginning involving downloading the data and doing the calculations. These only need to be completed once, unless you change the data source or update analyses.
