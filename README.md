# Code associated with Cannataro et al. BBA mini-review 2024

This code will reproduce the analysis within the review, including downloading the data, running the calculations, and creating the figures.


Run the code within the `R/MAIN_script.R` script to complete the analysis. If it is your first time running this code, you need to remove comments on the `source()` files at the beginning involving downloading the data and doing the calculations. The data download and initial calculations only need to be completed once, unless you change the data source or update analyses.
